**Type:** landing

## Goal

Ship the Hack the Andes site and participant pipeline: a selective in-person
hackathon in Lima (17–18 October 2026), with a public landing, CLI/API
registration, and a preselection path that is not invite-only.

## Done when

- The public landing presents the event, prizes, and how to apply.
- A participant can apply, check status, and confirm attendance after
  acceptance through the CLI or the web app.
- Preselection includes rotating technical challenges and a public ranking,
  not just a form.

## Current state

The registration API and Effect CLI are implemented. The landing now presents
a shorter WebGL Sacred Valley opening, a hundred-seat senior event, three
sealed event challenges, five judge seats, five mentor seats, direct prize
amounts, participant logistics, and Chofex as principal sponsor.

## Next action

Complete production QA, confirm the application deadline and venue release
policy, then publish the landing.
